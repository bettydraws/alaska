            <div class="menu-item-name"> Heritage </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Throughout Alaska's culture and history, there is Native heritage. Many villages and areas like Ketchikan, Icy Strait Point, Anchorage, and Kotzebue still live in traditional ways. The five main groups of Alaska's indigenous people are Aleuts, Northern Eskimos "Inupiat", Southern Eskimos "Yuit", Interior Indians "Athabascans", and Southeast Coastal Indians "Tlingit and Haida". Even though the majority of Alaska is defined by Native culture, there is still a broad mixture of cultures to be found in Alaska. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Traditions </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> The people of Alaska have many traditions such as dog mushing, gold panning, Native arts and crafts, subsistence fishing, bone carving, handmade dance masks, subsistence hunting, and so much more. From my experience, the dog mushing and gold panning tend to be their most popular traditions of the bunch. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Popular Foods </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> As guessed, the popular foods of Alaska mostly have to do with fish because of their popularity of salmon. Some of the best, mouth-watering foods you must try in Alaska are reindeer dogs, smoked salmon anything, black cod, chocolate bread, gumbo, any fresh jam or dessert with berries, crab, Eskimo ice cream, and so many more that the list could go on. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> History </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Alaska was inhabited by Indigenous people prior to the Europeans arrival. After the initial expedition, the Russians settled in Alaska in the 1780s which was followed by the Spanish. The US eventually purchased Alaska from the Russians in 1867 for over $7 million. Alaska has been the only settled community in the 1900s until the gold rushes of the 1890s to 1910 and saw thousands of miners descend upon the area. Throughout Alaska, there are many areas and tours to walk you through and show you the wonders of Alaska's history and how it became what it is today.  </div>

            <div class="menu-item-name"> Jobs in Alaska </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> With a small population, the most popular jobs available are, zoologists, wildlife biologists, geological and petroleum technicians, airline pilots, copilots, flight engineers, material moving workers, and a lot of family-owned or freelance business are to be found in Alaska. If you ever travel to Alaska you will notice right away the majority of stores or businesses in Alaska are family owned or created from the ground up by locals. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Pros </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> The perks of living in Alaska are the diversity of people and the Summer sunshine when they get 19.5 hours of sunlight a day. Also, in Alaska, since there's not much population, in one area everyone would know everyone as if their a close family. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Cons </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> The drawbacks of living in Alaska would be the weather, rain, long nights, and cold winters. Another con would be the shipping and on my trip we even talked to one of the residents about this, she said,"If I went to go buy milk and there was only one left and the shipment is delayed, if I don't buy that milk I could be without it for weeks and especially since we only have one place to buy milk from". I could see how the lack of attention Alaska gets for shipping could be really annoying and could affect the people greatly. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Life Expectancy </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Alaska is the 35th highest US State when it comes to life expectancy with the average being 78.3 years. I thought that seemed pretty high for life expectancy but it's not in the top ten US States like Hawaii, Minnesota, Puerto Rico, Connecticut, California, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and New Jersey are. </div>

            <div class="menu-item-name"> Alaska's Climate </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Throughout the year and with a look at their climate, the best time to travel to Alaska would be in the Summertime. Alaska's Summertime varies anywhere from May - September with June and July being the best time to travel. Although the weather is not predictable the people in Alaska never let it affect their mood or their plans. According to Alaskan tours, the longest day of the year is June 21st with a total 18 - 22 hours of daylight, depending on where you are in Alaska. Alaska is also known to get a lot of rain and over the Summer, they tend to get more as the Summer progresses and especially during the month of August. </div>

          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Mountains </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> One of the most common scenery view you see in Alaska is their mountains. There are many large mountains, volcanic regions, and wilderness scattered across Alaska with Mount McKinley being the tallest mountain not only in Alaska but in the US at 20,320 feet tall. Brookes Range and the Arctic foothills are the top of the three major Alaskan mountain groups. In Alaska, there are 30 different mountain ranges and you'd find 17 of the 20 highest mountain peaks in the United States in Alaska. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Location </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Geographically Alaska is located to the north of the Arctic Ocean, north of the Beaufort Sea, north of the Chukchi Sea, to the south of the Gulf of Alaska and Pacific Ocean, to the west of the Bering Sea, to the east south of the Alaska borders Canada, and to the east south of the Yukon Territory and British Columbia.  </div>

            <div class="menu-item-name"> "The Great Land" </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Alaska, the great land as the Natives call it and for a good reason. Alaska is the last State known where a man can travel 600 miles in a straight line and never cross a barbwire fence ever. Alaska has many other nicknames that can describe their environment and area their in such as, great county, mainland, the great land, Alyeska, the last frontier, and the land of the midnight sun.</div>

            <div class="menu-item-name"> Types of Wildlife </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Within Alaska, you can find many types of bears such as the polar bear which is found in the northernmost Alaskan territory, a large number of brown bears, and black bears. Also, you could find goats, bison, walrus, whales, otters, seals, and many fish with no surprise of salmon being the most common. From my experience, there are more spottings of seals than whales which is because Alaska has the worlds largest colony of seals. Lastly, another species you'll find in Alaska are birds such as the bald eagle being the most popular, owls, snowy owls, great grey owls, ducks, puffins, geese, and penguins. Puffins and penguins are both only found in certain areas of Alaska and not all over like some of their other wildlife.  </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Nature </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Alaska's State flower is the Forget-Me-Not flower which can be found all around Alaska. Furthermore, there are many other types of flowers and plants Alaska calls their own like the Western Columbine, Rusty Menziesia, Salmonberry, Nagoonberry, Monkey Flower, Skunk Cabbage, Pond Lily, Dwarf Fireweed, Goosetongue, and many more. Majority of their plants have unique names that some have probably never heard of before. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Northern Lights </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> Sadly, when I was in Alaska I never got to see any of the Northern Lights, but from what I heard the best time to see the Northern Lights is from mid-September to late April. The best area to possibly see the Northern Lights is the remote village of Coldfoot, in the Brooke Mountain Range. Other great areas to view the Northern Lights are Fairbanks, Denali National Park, Nome, Anchorage, Barrow, and finally Juneau. Out of all the best areas the only place I actually visited on my trip was Juneau but unfortunately, when I was there it was all rain no clear skies that day. </div>
          </div>
          <div class="menu-item">
            <div class="menu-item-name"> Glaciers </div>
            <div class="menu-item-description"> There are many different glaciers found in Alaska. Fun Fact, whenever a chunk falls off you can hear it before you even see it fall. Just to name a few, here are some of the glaciers you can find in Alaska, Mendenhall, Hubbard, Columbia, Matanuska, Exit, Harding, Portage, Margerie, Spencer, Taku, Worthington, grand Pacific, Muir, Knik, Lamplugh, and many more. </div>
